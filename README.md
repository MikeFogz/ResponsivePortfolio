Homework Assignment #2: Groundwork for my portfolio

## Overview

This will be an ongoing project as I learn and develop my web dev skills.

My aim for this Responsive Portfolio is to showcase my coding ability and growth during this bootcamp. I hope that as I learn, develop, and gain a firm grasp on both the front end and back end of web dev that this portfolio will reflect that.
